# Dog_Breed_Classification

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network based on Dog Breed Classifier implemented using Pytorch.
The Model is trained using Resnet34.
The main goal of the model is to predcit the breed of the dogs by the image of it. 
The model is trained using the Standford Dog Breed dataset. 
Pytorch has been used as the main framework using its functions such as torchvison, Datasets etc. 

# Future Improvements
To implement a frontend for the project. 
To use other trained models to increase accuracy.
